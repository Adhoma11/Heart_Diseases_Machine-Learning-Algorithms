features
• Age :- age of person

• Sex :- the gender of person

• Cp :- Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a form of diastolic heart 
failure that arises because an inelastic pericardium inhibits 
cardiac filling. 

• Trestbps:- The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on 
admission to the hospital) chol: The person's cholesterol 
measurement in mg/dl. fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar 
(> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) restecg: resting 
electrocardiographic results.

• Chol:- Cholesterol

• Fbs:-Fanconi Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare condition 
characterized by the accumulation of a substance called 
glycogen in different parts of the body. 
features

• Restecg:-Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = 
normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing 
probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' 
criteria) 

• Thalach:- The person's maximum heart rate achieved.

• Exang:- ST depression induced by. exercise relative to 
rest(oldpeak), the slope of the peak. exercise ST 
segment(slope), number of major vessels. colored by 
flourosopy(ca) and thalassemia(thal) for prediction of heart 
diseases

• Oldpeak:- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

• Slope:- The ST segment shift relative to exercise-induced 
increments in heart rate

• Ca:- Calcium in blood 

• Thal:-Thalassemia is an inherited (i.e., passed from parents to 
children through genes) blood disorder caused when the body 
doesn't make enough of a protein called hemoglobin, an important 
part of red blood cells.
